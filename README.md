# Liquidsoap

Liquidsoap is a swiss-army knife for multimedia streaming, notably
used for netradios and webtvs. It has tons of features, it's free and it's
open-source!

Liquidsoap is a powerful and flexible language for describing your streams. It
offers a rich collection of operators that you can combine to create and
transform streams. Liquidsoap is very light and easy to use, in the Unix
tradition of simple strong components working together.

### Versions

Liquidsoap releases follow a semantic versioning as follows:

```
<major_version>.<minor_version>.<bugfix_version>
```

Where:

- `major_version` is bumped when there are major changes, i.e. changes in the paradigm, major implementation change etc. Versions with different major versions **are** incompatible
- `minor_version` is bumped when there are minor changes, i.e. new operators, renaming, new modules etc. Version with different minor versions **may be** incompatible
- `bugfix_version` is bumped when a new bugfix version is published. Versions with only bugfix version changes **should be** compatible

Please note that liquidsoap is a complex framework with a lot of operators and advanced implementations. For this reason, it is possible that a bugfix actually fixes the behavior of an operator the way it was intended to be and may break scripts that previously relied on incorrect implementations.

Therefore, we **strongly** recommend maintaining a `staging` environment that makes it possible to test new versions before using them in production. In this context, the semantic versioning above should guide you in knowing how much scrutiny you should put into a new release before validating it in your staging environment.

### Assets

Release assets are provided at: https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases. Published, versioned releases are available using their published tag, i.e. `vx.y.z`.

We also provide **rolling releases**. A rolling release is a snapshot of a current, unpublished release. It can be a future stable release or a future bugfix release for a given major/minor version.

For both types of releases, we reserve the right to update, delete and add assets to the release at any time. If you are looking for permanent links to release assets, you should grab them from https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-release-assets/releases, which reflects all our releases but whose artifacts are never modified/deleted.
