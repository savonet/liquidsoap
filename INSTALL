 Liquidsoap 1.0.1
 ----------------

 Below is a list of dependencies, mostly OCaml libraries.
 Optional libraries provide extra features. They need to be detected
 by the "configure" script.

 Most of the libraries are developed by the Savonet project and,
 in addition to being available through traditional distribution
 channels, are bundled in the liquidsoap-<version>-full.tar.bz2 tarballs
 for easier builds.

 Libraries not developed by Savonet are:
   ocaml-pcre, ocaml-magic, ocaml-sdl
   camomile, json-wheel, camlimages, gd4o


 Mandatory dependencies :

   ocaml-dtools>=0.3.0
   ocaml-duppy>=0.4.2
   ocaml-mm>=0.2.0
   ocaml-pcre

 Recommended dependencies :

   camomile                 for charset recoding in metadata

 How to install
 --------------

 *BSD users, as well as OSX users might need to export some variables 
 that can be missing during the process:
   % export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
   % export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
   % export OCAMLMKLIB_FLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib 
 Also, liquidsoap needs GNU make. If you have a GNU make, this is normally
 detected during configuration. If this check fails you can set the MAKE
 variable:
   % export MAKE=`your make command`

 The following assumes your MAKE command is make. Change to yours if
 different.

 Now you can start the build configuration:
   % ./configure

 If you want a complete installation of liquidsoap, enabling a production
 use of liquidsoap as a daemon, you should pass --with-user=<login> and
 --with-group=<group> options to indicate which user/group you have
 created for liquidsoap.

 Then, build the software:
   % make

 You can also generate the documentation for liquidsoap:
   % make doc

 It will generate the HTML documentation, including a version of the scripting
 API reference corresponding to your configuration. If Perl's module XML::DOM
 is not available it only generate a stub reference and issue a warning.

 Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.

   % make install

 This will not install files such as /var/log/liquidsoap unless you have
 provided a user/group under which liquidsoap should be ran. This behavior
 can be overridden by passing INSTALL_DAEMON="yes" (useful for preparing
 binary packages).

 For installing developers documentation, run:

   % make api-doc-install

 Then if you want services to be installed in $prefix/etc/init.d, run one of
 the following. service is for a generic /bin/sh service, gentoo is for
 a gentoo compliant service, to be used iff you've a gentoo linux.

   % make (service|gentoo)-install

 See /doc for understanding liquidsoap scripting. Have fun!
