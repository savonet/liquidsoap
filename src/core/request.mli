(** A request is something from which we can produce a file. *)

(** An indicator is a resource location (URI), when meaningful, it can be
    declared as temporary if liquidsoap should destroy it after usage (this
    means deleting a local file). *)

(** Root configuration node. *)

(** Create an indicator. *)
val indicator :
  ?metadata:Frame.metadata -> ?temporary:bool -> string -> indicator

(** Return a prettified string. *)

  t

(** Return the request's initial uri. *)
val initial_uri : t -> string

(** Destroying of a requests causes its file to be deleted if it's a temporary
    one, for example a downloaded file. If the metadata ["persistent"] is set to
    ["true"], destroying doesn't happen, unless [force] is set too. Persistent
    sources are useful for static URIs (see below for the definition of
    staticity, and in [src/sources/one_file.ml] for an example of use). *)

(** Get the list of all requests. *)
val all : unit -> t list

(** Retrieve a request from its id. *)

(** {1 Resolving}

    Resolving consists in many steps. Every step consist in rewriting the first
    URI into other URIs. The process ends when the last URI is a local filename.
    For example, the initial URI can be a database query, which is then turned
    into a remote locations, which is then tentatively downloaded... At each
    step [protocol.resolve uri timeout] is called, and the function is expected
    to push the new URIs in the request. *)

    Sometimes, it allows removing useless destroy/create/resolve. *)

    audio file, or simply because there was no enough time left. *)

    the resolving hasn't been run, if the initial URI was already a local
    filename. *)

    is ready. *)

(** Metadata are resolved from the first indicator to the last, the last one
    overriding the ones before. The only exception are root metadata, which are
    metadata internal to liquidsoap such as request id and etc. These cannot be

    exceptions otherwise. *)

(** Duration resolvers. *)
