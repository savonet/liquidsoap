(** In [`CPU] mode, synchronization is governed by the CPU clock.

    In [`None] mode, there is no synchronization control. Latency in is governed
    by the time it takes for the sources to produce and output data.

    In [`Auto] mode, synchronization is governed by the CPU unless at least one
    active source is declared [self_sync] in which case latency is delegated to
    this source. A typical example being a source linked to a sound card, in
    which case the source latency is governed by the sound card's clock.

    Another case is synchronous network protocol such as [input.srt]. *)

  (** This method passes the frame returned by [#get_frame] to the given callback.
           The callback should return the portion of the frame (of the form: [start, end))

           whenever possible and returned during the next streaming cycle. Final returned value
           is the same as the partial chunk returned from the callback for easy method call chaining.

  (** This method requests a specific field of the frame that can be mutated. It
      is used by a consumer of the source that will modify the source's data
      (e.g. [amplify]). The source will do its best to minimize data copy
      according to the streaming context. Typically, if there is only one
      consumer of the source's data, it should be safe to pass its data without
      copying it. *)
  method get_mutable_content : Frame.field -> Content.data

  (** This method is the same as [#get_mutable_content] but returns a full frame
      with the requested mutable field included. *)
  method get_mutable_frame : Frame.field -> Frame.t

  (** By convention, frames produced during the streaming cycle can only have at
      most one track mark. In case of multiple track marks (which most likely
      indicate a programming problem), all subsequent track marks past the first
      one are dropped.

      This function returns a pair: [(initial_frame, new_track option)] of an
      initial frame and, if a track mark is present in the frame, the optional
      portion of the frame contained after this track mark.

      This method can be used to implement operations that should be aware of
      new tracks. *)
