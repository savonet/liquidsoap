- Reimplemented CUE file parser in native liquidsoap script,
  added support for multiple files and EAC non-compliant extension
  (#1373, #4330)
- Make `"song"` metadata mapping to `"title"` metadata in

  is also passed. Add a configuration key to disable this mechanism.
  (#4235, #2676)
- `output.icecast` now re-sends the last metadata when connecting to the
  remote server unless explicitly disabled using the `send_last_metadata_on_connect`
  option (#3906)
- Add full explicit support for `ipv4` vs. `ipv6` resolution in SRT inputs and outputs,

# 2.3.0 (2024-11-27)

New:

- Rewrote the streaming API to work with immutable frame content. This
  should greatly impact impredictable side-effect of the previous models w.r.t.
  track marks, content sharing and more. This also impacts multiple operators
  behavior. Mostly, things should be roughly the same with differences around
  behaviors related to track marks (`source.on_track` and etc). (#3577)
- Added script caching layer for faster script startup time. See: https://www.liquidsoap.info/blog/2024-06-13-a-faster-liquidsoap/ for details (#3924, #3949, #3959 and #3977)
- Rewrote the clock/streaming loop layer. This prepares our streaming system to
  support multicore when the OCaml compiler is mature enough to allow it. Clocks
  are now attached to sources via their `clock` methods. Returned value is a stripped
  down `clock` variable. Users can use the `clock` function to retrieve the full
  methods, e.g. `s = sine(); c = clock(s.clock)`. This value has advanced functions
  for clock control such as `start`/`stop`, `ticks` and `self_sync` to check for
  `self-sync`. (#3781)
- Allow frames duration shorter than one video frames, typically values under `0.04s`.
  Smaller frames means less latency and memory consumption at the expense of
  a higher CPU usage (#3607)
- Change default frame duration to `0.02s` (#4033)
- Optimized runtime (#3927, #3928, #3919)
- Added NDI output support (#4181)
- Added `finally` to execute code regardless of whether or not an exception is raised
  (see: #3895 for more details).
- Added support for Spinitron submission API (#4158)
- Removed gstreamer support. Gstreamer's architecture was never a good fit for us
  and created a huge maintenance and debugging burden and it had been marked as
  deprecated for a while. Most, if not all of its features should be available using
  `ffmpeg`. (#4036)
- Removed `taglib` support. It is superseded by the internal `ocaml-metadata` module
  and taglib, with its dependency on the C++ runtime library, has been causing issues
  with binary builds portability and crashes with the (not yet supported) OCaml 5
  compiler. (#4087)
- Added `video.canvas` to make it possible to position video elements independently
  of the rendered video size ([#3656](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/pull/3656), [blog post](https://www.liquidsoap.info/blog/2024-02-10-video-canvas-and-ai/))
- Added cover manager from an original code by @vitoyucepi (#3651)
- Added non-interleaved API to `%ffmpeg` encoder, enabled by default when only
  one stream is encoded.
- Allow trailing commas in record definition (#3300).
- Added `metadata.getter.source.float` (#3356).
- BREAKING: Added `duration` and `ticks` to metadata available when computing HLS segment names (#4135)
- Added optional `main_playlist_writer` to `output.file.hls` and
  derivated operator (#3484)
- Added `is_nan`, `is_infinite`, `ceil`, `floor`, `sign` and `round` (#3407)
- Added `%track.drop` to the `%ffmpeg` encoder to allow partial encoding
  of a source's available tracks (#3480)
- Added `let { foo? } = ...` pattern matching (#3481)
- Added `metadata.replaygain` method to extract unified replay gain value from metadata (#3438).
- Added `metadata.parse.amplify` to manually parse amplify override metadata.
- Added `compute` parameter to `file.replaygain` to control gain calculation (#3438).
- Added `compute` parameter to `enable_replaygain_metadata` to control replay gain calculation (#3438).
- Added `copy:` protocol (#3506)
- Added `file.touch`.
- Added support for sqlite databases (#3575).
- Added `string.of_int` and `string.spaces`.
- Added `list.assoc.nullable`.
- Added `source.cue` (#3620).
- Added `string.chars` (#4111)
- Added atomic file write operations.
- Added new `macos_say` speech synthesis protocol. Make it the default implementation for the `say:`
  protocol on `macos`.
- Added `settings.request.timeout` to set the request timeout globally.

Changed:

- Reimplemented `request.once`, `single` and more using `source.dynamic`. Removed experiment
  flag on `source.dynamic`. The operator is considered stable enough to define advanced sources
  but the user should be careful when using it.
- Mute SDL startup messages (#2913).
- `int` can optionally raises an error when passing `nan` or `infinity`, `int(infinity)`
  now returns `max_int` and `int(-infinity)` returns `min_int`. (#3407)
- Made default font a setting (#3507)
- Changed internal metadata format to be immutable (#3297).
- Removed `source.dump` and `source.drop` in favor of safer `request.dump` and `request.drop`.
  `source.{dump, drop}` can still be implemented manually when needed and with the proper
  knowledge of what's going on.
- Allow a getter for the offset of `on_offset` and dropped the metadata
  mechanism for updating it (#3355).
- `string.length` and `string.sub` now default to `utf8` encoding (#4109)
- Disable output paging when `TERM` environment variable is not set.
- Allow running as `root` user inside `docker` container by default (#3406).
- Run `check_next` before playlist's requests resolutions (#3625)
- Set `force` to `true` by default in `file.copy` to make operator behave
  as expected.
- BREAKING: Float comparison now follows the expected specs, in particular: `nan == x` is always `false` and
  `nan != x` is always `true`. Use `float.is_nan` to test if a float is `nan`.
- BREAKING: `replaygain` no longer takes `ebu_r128` parameter (#3438).
- BREAKING: assume `replaygain_track_gain` always stores volume in _dB_ (#3438).
- BREAKING: protocols can now check for nested static uri. Typically, this means
  that requests for an uri of the form: `annotate:key="value",...:/path/to/file.mp3`
  is now considered infallible if `/path/to/file.mp3` can be decoded.
- Added `parents` option of `file.mkdir` (#3600, #3601).
- Added `forced_major_collections` record field to the result of `runtime.gc.stat()` and
  `runtime.gc.quick_stat()` (#3783).
- Changed the port for the built-in Prometheus exporter to `9599` (#3801).
- Set `segments_overheader` in HLS outputs to disable segments cleanup altogether.
- Added support for caching LV2 and LADSPA plugins (#3959).
- Pulseaudio input and output now restart on pulseaudio errors (#4174).

Fixed:

- Fixed type generalization on values returned from function applications. Most notably,
  this should help with HTTP endpoint registration (#3303, fixed in #4030)

---

# 2.2.5 (2024-05-01) (Mayday!)

New:

- Added `enable_autocue_metadata` and `autocue:` protocol to automatically compute cue points and crossfade parameters (#3753, #3811, @RM-FM and @Moonbase59)
- Added various ffmpeg timestamps when exporting ffmpeg metadata from filters.
- Added `db_levels` method to `blank.*` sources (#3790)
- Added `excluded_metadata_resolvers` to `request.create` to make it possible to selectively disable specific metadata resolvers when resolving requests.
- Normalized expected API from `autocue`, allow multiple implementation and adapt `cross`/`crossfade` to work with it out of the box with workaround for short tracks.
- Added private and swapped memory reporting when compiled with `mem_usage`.
- Added priorities to metadata deocoders, allows finer-control of metadata overriding. (#3887)

- Added option to set preferred address class (`ipv4`, `ipv6` or system default) when resolving hostnames in http transports and `output.icecast`
- Added `self_sync` option to `input.srt` to accommodate for streams in file mode (#3684)
- Added `curve` parameter to fade functions and `liq_fade_{in,skip,out}_curve` metadata override (#3691)
- Added `delay` parameter to fade functions to make it possible to add delay before fade happens. Add `liq_fade_{in,skip,out}_delay` metadata override.
- Added `single_track` option to allow `sequence` to play each source until they are unavailable while keeping track marks.

Changed:

- `cue_cut` operator has been removed. Cueing mechanisms have been moved to underlying file-based sources. See migration notes for more details.

Fixed:

- Fix pop/click at the end of fade out/in (#3318)
- Fix audio/video synchronization issues when decoding live streams using ffmpeg.
- Fix issues with TLS connecting clients not being properly timed out (#3598)

---

# 2.2.1 (2023-09-05)

Changed:

- BREAKING: on HLS outputs, `on_file_change` events are
  now `"created"`, `"updated"` and `"deleted"`, to better
  reflect the new atomic file operations (#3284)
- Added `compact` argument to the `http.response.json` function. `http.response.json` will produce minified JSON by
  default. Added a newline symbol to the end of the JSON data produced by `http.response.json`. (#3299)
- Bumped internal ogg decoder to make sure that it is used over the ffmpeg decoder whenever possible.
  FFmpeg has issues with metadata in chained streams which needs to be fixed upstream. Unfortunately,
  `input.http` can only use the ffmpeg decoder at the moment.
- Cleanup `output.file` encoding and file handling logic (#3328)
- Added `ratio` to `source.{dump,drop}` to make it possible to control its CPU peaks.

- Make all HLS file write atomic (#3284)
- Allow seek and cue operators to work with muxed sources
  using a single underlying source (#3252)
- Fixed export of cover art metadata (#3279)
- Remove use of `stereo:` protocol in `say:` protocol:
  this is now handled automatically by the decoder and generates latency via
  high CPU usage peak.
- Fixed `output.file` reopening with flac encoding (#3328)

---

# 2.2.0 (2023-07-21)

New:

- Added support for less memory hungry audio formats, namely
  `pcm_s16` and `pcm_f32` (#3008)
- Added support for native osc library (#2426, #2480).
- SRT: added support for passphrase, pbkeylen, streamid,
  added native type for srt sockets with methods, moved stats
  to socket methods, added `socket()` method on srt input/outputs
  (#2556)
- HLS: Added support for ID3 in-stream metadata (#3154) and
  custom tags (#2898).
- Added support for FLAC metadata (#2952)

  raw PCM stream and file (#3066)
- Added support for unit interactive variables: those call a handler when their
  value is set.
- Added support for id3v2 `v2.2.0` frames and pictures.
- Added `track.audio.defer` to be used to buffer large amount of audio data (#3136)
- Added `runtime.locale.force` to force the system's locale (#3231)
- Added support for customizable, optimized `jemalloc` memory allocator (#3170)

  - `file.replaygain` to compute the replaygain of a file
- Added support for ImageLib to decode images.
- Added support for completion in emacs based on company (#2652).
- Added syntactic sugar for record spread: `let {foo, gni, ..y} = x`
  and `y = { foo = 123, gni = "aabb", ...x}` (#2737)
- Added `file.{copy, move}` (#2771)
- Detect functions defining multiple arguments with the same label (#2823).
- Added `null.map`.
- References of type `'a` are now objects of type `(()->'a).{set : ('a) -> unit}`. This means that you should use `x()` instead of `!x` in order to get
  the value of a reference. Setting a reference can be done both by `x.set(v)`
  and `x := v`, which is still supported as a notation (#2881).
- Added `ref.make` and `ref.map`.
- Added `video.board`, `video.graph`, `video.info` (#2886).
- Added the `pico2wave` protocol in order to perform speech synthesis using
  [Pico TTS](https://github.com/naggety/picotts) (#2934).
- Added `settings.protocol.gtts.lang` to be able to select `gtts`' language,
  added `settings.protocol.gtts.options` to be able to add any other option (#3182)
- Added `settings.protocol.pico2wave.lang` to be able to select `pico2wav` language (#3182)
- Added `"metadata_url"` to the default list of exported metadata (#2946)
- Added log colors!
- Added `list.filter_map` and `list.flatten`.
- Added `medialib` in order to store metadata of files in a folder and query
  them (#3115).
- Added `--unsafe` option (#3113). This makes the startup much faster but
  disables some guarantees (and might even make the script crash...).
- Added `string.split.first` (#3146).
- Added `string.getter.single` (#3125).

Changed:

- Switched to `dune` for building the binary and libraries.
- Changed `cry` to be a required dependency.
- Changed default character encoding in `output.harbor`, `output.icecast`
  `output.shoutcast` to `UTF-8` (#2704)
- BREAKING: all `timeout` settings and parameters are now `float` values
  and in seconds (#2809)
- BREAKING: in `output.{shoutcast,icecast}`:
  - Old `icy_metadata` renamed to `send_icy_metadata` and changed to a nullable `bool`. `null` means guess.
  - New `icy_metadata` now returns a list of metadata to send with ICY updates.
  - Added `icy_song` argument to generate default `"song"` metadata for ICY updates. Defaults
    to `<artist> - <title>` when available, otherwise `artist` or `title` if available, otherwise
    `null`, meaning don't add the metadata.
  - Cleanup, removed parameters that were irrelevant to each operator, i.e. `icy_id` in `output.icecast` and etc.
  - Make `mount` mandatory and `name` nullable. Use `mount` as `name` when `name` is `null`.
- `reopen_on_error` and `reopen_on_metadata` in `output.file` and related operators are now callbacks to
  allow dynamic handling.
- Added `reopen` method to `output.file`.
- Added support for a Javascript build an interpreter.
- Removed support for `%define` variables, superseded by support for actual
  variables in encoders.
- Cancel pending append when skipping current track on `append` source.

  possible to programmatically point to file, line and character offsets
  of each step in the error call trace (#2712)
- Reimplemented `harbor` http handler API to be more flexible. Added a new
  node/express-like registration and middleware API (#2599).
- Switched default persistence for cross and fade-related overrides
  to follow documented behavior. By default, `"liq_fade_out"`, `"liq_fade_skip"`,
  `"liq_fade_in"`, `"liq_cross_duration"` and `"liq_fade_type"` now all reset on
  new tracks. Use `persist_overrides` to revert to previous behavior
  (`persist_override` for `cross`/`crossfade`) (#2488).
- Allow running as root by default when docker container can be detected using
  the presence of a `/.dockerenv` file.
- `id3v2` argument of `%mp3` encoder changed to `"none"` or version number to allow
  to choose the metadata version. `true` is still accepted and defaults to version
  `3`. Switched to our internal implementation so that it does not require `taglib`
  anymore.
- Moved HLS outputs stream info as optional methods on their respective encoder.
- Changed `self_sync` in `input.ffmpeg` to be a boolean getter, changed `self_sync`
  in `input.http` to be a nullable boolean getter. Set `self_sync` to `true` in
  `input.http` when an icecast or shoutcast server can be detected.
- Add `sorted` option to `file.ls`.
- Add `buffer_length` method to `input.external.rawaudio` and
  `input.external.wav` (#2612).

  `video.add_text`, etc.) (#2623).
- Add `on_cycle` option to `video.add_text` to register a handler when cycling
  (#2621).
- Renamed `{get,set}env` into `environment.{get,set}`
- Renamed `add_decoder`, `add_oblivious_decoder` and `add_metadata_resolver`
  into, respectively, `decoder.add`, `decoder.oblivious.add`, `decoder.metadata.add`
- Deprecated `get_mime`, added `file.mime.libmagic` and `file.mime.cli`, made
  `file.mime` try `file.mime.libmagic` if present and `file.mime.cli` otherwise,
  changed eturned value when no mime was found to `null()`.
- Return a nullable float in `request.duration`.
- Removed `--list-plugins-json` and `--list-plugins-xml` options.
- Added `--list-functions-json` option.
- Removed built-in use of `strftime` conversions in output filenames, replaced
  by an explicit call to `time.string` (#2593)
- Added nullable default to `{int,float,bool}_of_string` conversion functions, raise
  an exception if conversion fails and no default is given.
- Deprecated `string_of` in favor of `string` (#2700).
- Deprecated `string_of_float` in favor of `string.float` (#2700).
- Added `settings.protocol.youtube_dl.timeout` to specify timeout when using
  `youtube-dl` protocol (#2827). Use `yt-dlp` as default binary for the
  protocol.
- The `sleeper` operator is now scripted (#2899).
- Reworked remote request file extension resolution (#2947)
- REMOVED `osx-secure-transport`. Doubt it was ever used, API deprecated
  upstream (#3067)
- Renamed `rectangle` to `add_rectangle`, and similarly for `line`.

Fixed:

- The randomization function `list.shuffle` used in `playlist` was incorrect and
  could lead to incorrectly randomized playlists (#2507, #2500).
- Fixed srt output in listener mode to allow more than one listener at a time and
  prevent listening socket from being re-created on listener disconnection (#2556)
- Fixed race condition when switching `input.ffmpeg`-based urls (#2956)
- Fixed deadlock in `%external` encoder (#3029)
- Fixed crash in encoders due to concurrent access (#3064)
- Fixed long-term connection issues with SSL (#3067)

New:

- Added `buffer_length` method to `buffer` operator.
- Always display error backtrace when a fatal exception
  is raised in the streaming loop.
- Added `umask()` to get the current `umask` and `umask.set(...)`
  to set the current `umask` (#2840)

Changed:

- Add break when restarting the external process in `input.external.{rawaudio,rawvideo}`
  (#2860, #2872)
- Removed `disconnect` method on `input.harbor`. This method was doing the same as
  the `stop` method. Added `shutdown` method to properly shutdown the
  source even when not connected to an output.
- Made process a string getter in `input.external.{rawaudio,rawvideo}` (#2877)

Fixed:

- Fixed parameter type for `stats_interval` in SRT I/O.

  `output.file` (#2842)
- Fixed default directory permissions in `output.*.hls`
  operators (#2930)

- Fixed internal streaming logic in `max_duration` and `crossfade`.
- Make sure that there's at most one metadata at any given
  frame position (#2786)
- Fixed `metadata.json.parse` always returns an empty list (#2816).
- Fixed `icy_id` being ignored in `output.shoutcast` (#2819)

---

# 2.1.3 (2022-11-04)

New:

- Added `time.string`.
- Added `error.on_error` to report any error raised during the
  script's execution. Enhanced reported error positions (#2712)
- Added `device_id` and `latency` options to `input.portaudio`
  and `output.portaudio` to be able to choose the requested
  device. Use `liquidsoap --list-portaudio-devices` to see the
  list of devices (#2733)
- Added `disconnect` method to `input.harbor`, making it possible
  to disconnect a source client programmatically, including when
  a new client is trying to connect.

Changed:

- Send data in-memory in `http.{post,put}.file` when input data
  is already in memory. This allows to use plain `Content-Length`
  instead of `chunked` transfer encoding in these case, though
  `libcurl` seems to always prefer `chunked` encoding for `put`
  requests.
- Better error message when an encoder is not available on windows
  (#2665)

Changed:

- Removed support for partial application, which should avoid some type errors,
  improve performance and simplifies the code related to the reduction (#2204).
- Video dimensions (width and height) can now be specified per stream in the
  type and are then used instead of the default ones. For instance, you can now
  write
  ```
  s = (single("file.mp4") : source(video(width=300,height=200)))
  ```
  in order to force the decoding of a file to be performed at the 300×200
  resolution (#2212).
- Video images are now _canvas_, which means that they do not directly contain
  the images, but are constituted of multiple images placed at various
  positions. This should make much more efficient operations such as making
  videos from multiple ones, adding a logo, etc. (#2207)

  those (#2227).
- Default implementation of `video.testsrc` is now builtin, previous
  implementation can be found under `video.testsrc.ffmpeg`.

  the muxing operators.
- Raise runtime exceptions in `string.replace` failures with
  useful message. (#2408)
- Prevent `request.dynamic` from raising exceptions when checking
  if the source is ready (#2381)

- and as usual, various improvements in the code, log and error messages, etc.

  # 1.0.0 (08-10-2011)

Finally, the 1.0.0 release! It brings several important fixes, but
also some nice novelties.
The most outstanding difference concerns `output.icecast()`: its restart
and `restart_delay` parameters are gone, replaced by a new `on_stop` handler
which is called on every error (failed connection or disconnection) and
returns the new restart delay. The `on_error` handler receives a string
describing the error which enables user-friendly reporting, adaptative
delays, etc.
Note that `on_error` defaults to `fun(_)->3`. which is equivalent to having
restart=true, restart_delay=3. in previous versions, NOT the same as the
former restart=false default. As a result, liquidsoap won't fail to startup
if an initial connection attempt fails.

Fixes:

- LS-532,527: avoid freeze after errors in streaming threads or source
  initialization routines
- LS-542: race condition in `playlist*()` breaking randomness
- LS-489: double expiration lead to illegal queue length and freeze of
  request-based sources
- Avoid multiple simultaneous reloading in `playlist*()`,
  thanks to Fabio Costa for his help on this one!
- Pass charset information to icecast server to avoid encoding bugs
- LS-555: timeout for icecast connection attempts
- LS-559: permanent stop after disconnection on Ogg streams
- LS-565: efficient and crash-free error handling in `input.http/harbor()`
  when the input stream has an invalid number of channels
- LS-431: proper handling of duration in `blank()` avoids abusive empty tracks
- LS-556: rework conversion operators, optimizations used to be unsafe & broken
- LS-574: silent MIDI synthesis operators
- LS-396: `drop*()`'s types reflect that they don't support variable arities
- LS-442: allow comments not terminated by newline at end of file
  New:
- `on_error` handler in `output.icecast()`, see above
- New msg param in %mp3 for marking frame headers, defaults to version string
- `output.file()`: new `on_close` parameter, may be used to write exact duration
- %mp3.vbr/abr for variable bitrate MP3, %mp3 is now a synonym of %mp3.cbr
- MP3 encoders now support ID3v2 tags
- `input.http()`: new "status" command
- LS-556: `mux_mono()` for adding a single audio channel into a stream
- `video.add_text()` using libgd (gd4o) for environments without X
  Dependency on graphics can be disabled (to work around erreneous detection)
- script language: add infix operator mod (patch by Fabio Costa)
- `delay()` now has an "initial" parameter
- LS-557: "server.timeout" setting can now be disabled by setting it to -1
- LS-532: `source.init()` for selective init with a way to handle errors,
  plus settings "clock.allow_streaming_errors" and "init.force_stat" (or
  --force-start on the command line) for easing dynamic uses of liquidsoap
  Enhancements:
- Panic crash to avoid frozen liquidsoap after duppy crashes
- Text-to-speech: festival and sox are now only runtime dependencies
- LS-475,516: better support for dynamic URL change in `input.http()`
- LS-484: display user-friendly error messages in interactive mode
- LS-308: use seconds internally in request sources, avoid overflow and
  display more user-friendly debug messages
- Cleanup `visu.volume()` and `video.vis_volume()`
- LS-573: replace " " by "\_" in identifiers to make them valid in the server
- Script syntax: unary minus now usable without parenthesis after semicolon
- Two generic queues by default, to avoid deadlocks in advanced situations
- Documentation, build & install system, etc.

  # 1.0.0 beta3 (05-08-2011)

- Feature: Added `of_json` to parse json data. Depends
  on json-wheel.
- Feature: Added file.exists and is_directory.
- Feature: Added timeout options for:
  telnet, harbor (server), input.icecast
- Enhancement: finer-grained timeout detection
  for `input.harbor` and `input.http`
- Fix: deadlock when disconnecting harbor users
  through server/telnet command.
- Fix: dynlink detection in native mode with old
  versions of ocaml
- Fix: deadlock when an exception is raised during
  startup while the clock is owned by a source
  (e.g. `input.alsa`). See LS-527 for more details.

  # 1.0.0 beta2.1 (07-07-2011)

- Fix: `playlist.safe()` was unusable in beta2, as a side effect of removing
  duplicate "timeout" parameter in `playlist()`.
- Minor enhancements to documentation, settings and reference.

  # 1.0.0 beta2 (04-07-2011)

This release introduces lots of fixes and cleanup, but also some new features.
Major novelties: support for fast seeking and cue points, FLAC and improved
AAC+ support, introduction of the liquidsoap yellowpages "flows",
plugin support and improved messages for scripting errors
Compatibility warning: `insert_metadata` has changed, and `clock.assign_new()`
should be used instead of `clock()` to avoid some of the new static checks

Decoders:

- New support for seeking and fast computation of durations in most formats
- New decoders: FLAC (native & Ogg) and images using Camlimages
- Fixes in Ogg decoding: LS-515 (loss of data) and LS-537 (segfault).
- Fix LS-337: periodical failures when decoding AAC(+) streams
- AAC(+): use new ocaml-faad with builtin mp4ff, easier to build
- New detection mechanism mixing extensions and MIME types (when available),
  with corresponding settings `decoder.file_extensions.<format>` and
  `decoder.mime_types.<format>`.
- Decoder order can be user-defined thanks to new settings
  "decoder.file_decoders", "decoder.stream_decoders" and
  "decoder.metadata_decoders".
- Indicate which decoder is used in the "decoder" metadata
- More helpful log for various errors
- Fix segfault with SdlImage image decoder

Encoders:

- New FLAC encoders %flac (native) and %ogg(%flac)
- New AAC+ 2.0 and vo-aacenc
- New settings to theora: keyframes make files much smaller!
- New settings for WAV encoding: headerless, samplesize.
- Fix segfaults with ocaml-aacplus
- Enhancement LS-441: filter metadata before encoding,
  based on the "encoder.metadata.export" setting.
- Rework infrastructure of encoded outputs to fit all formats, outputs
  and styles of metadata handling, file reopening (#386)

Harbor:

- New: `output.harbor()` which acts as a mini icecast server,
  accepting listeners directly. Encoding is shared among users,
  and is only performed when needed.
- New: ability to register HTTP GET/POST handlers to create simpler
  web services, using `harbor.http.register/remove()`.
- Make all settings local: port, user and password can be set independently
  for each `input.harbor()` source
- New: "metadata_charset" and "icy_metadata_charset" in `input.harbor()`
- Fix: race condition possibly leading to abusive "source taken" (LS-500)

Icecast:

- Add support for streaming native flac, only works when streaming to
  `input.harbor()`, not supported by actual Icecast servers
- Fix bugs in ICY protocol support (header parsing, user name)
- Use ICY metadata updates when streaming AAC(+)
- New: "encoding" parameter for `output.icecast()`, used for recoding metadata
  Defaults to "latin1" with shoutcast servers
- New: `icy.update_metadata()` function for manual updates
- Enhance default "song" metadata, avoiding " - " when unnecessary (#467)

Input/output:

- New experimental `input.v4l/v4l2()` for webcams
- New experimental `input/output.udp()` for unchecked UDP streaming,
  available with most formats (at your own risk)
- Restore `output.pipe.external()`, now called `output.external()`
- New parameters for most outputs and inputs (start, on_start,
  on_stop, fallible); cleanup and uniformize implementations (LS-365)
- New ALSA settings alsa.alsa_buffer, alsa.buffer_length and alsa.periods
  Setting periods=0 allows to not attempt to set the number periods,
  which is impossible on some devices
- New preference order in `input/output.preferred()`: pulseaudio, portaudio,
  oss, alsa, ao, dummy

Operators:

- New: support for cue points with `cue_cut()`
- Change `insert.metadata()` which is now more script friendly,
  returning an insertion function rather than register a server
  command. The old functionality is available as `server.insert_metadata()`.
- New: `rms()` operator for getting RMS of a stream, and `server.rms()` which
  makes this information available as a server command.
- New: `track_sensitive` mode for blank detection operators
- New: `playlist.reloadable()` for playing a list once, with a command
  for restarting it.
- Remove `id.*()` which can be replaced by type annotations

Scripting API:

- New: OSC support through `osc.bool()`, `osc.float()` and `osc.float_pair()`
- New: JSON export `json_of()`
- New: `http.get()` and `http.post()`
- New: `url.encode/decode()`, `base64.encode/decode()`
- New: `string.recode()` for charset conversions using camomile
- New: `notify_metadata()` and `osd_metadata()`, suitable for use with
  `on_track()` and `on_metadata()`
- New: `request.metadata()` for getting a request's metadata
- New: `string.length()`
- Enhance `log_clocks()` with parameter for delaying startup
- Enhance `get_clock_status()` with "uptime" reference time

Server interface:

- Print the playlist's URI when calling `<playlist>.uri` without an
  argument.
- Enhance `<queue>.ignore` now works also in the primary queue
- New command for changing the URL of an `input.http()`, ref #466. The
  command is `<id>.url` and it needs a restart (`<id>.stop`, then start)
  to take effect.
- Fixed double registration of server commands which resulted in broken
  "help" command (LS-521)

Script language:

- Option "-i" doesn't show types for pervasives anymore
- Pretty printing of types (LS-474) with indentation, also used
  in the documentation
- Enhanced type errors (LS-459): no more traces, only the relevant
  part of types is displayed, plus a few special friendly messages.
- Enhanced static checks (LS-123) thanks to the introduction of the
  `active_source` subtype, for unused variables and ignored values
  This should avoid common errors, help troubleshooting
  If needed, advanced users can work around errors using --check-lib
  and --errors-as-warnings

General:

- Do not attempt to install "daemon" files if user/group have not been
  set, unless forced using "make INSTALL_DAEMON= install"
- Fix several core "source protocol" bugs, causing assert failures and
  other crashes: LS-460 (source becomes not ready without operator knowing)
  #403 (information about being ready is not precise enough)
- Fix incorrect image accesses (LS-430) by introducing a safer VFrame API
  Applies to most video operators ( `video.fade()`, `video.text()`, effects...)
- Cleanup resource (de)allocation, which is becoming critical with dynamic
  reconfigurations (e.g., dynamic output creation, `source.dynamic()`)
  Enforce that server commands are always deallocated (LS-495)
  Attempt to stop sources when initialization fails, so they cleanup as
  much as possible (LS-503)
  Avoid deadlocks upon crashes in IoRing-based operators
  Share code for stoppable feeding threads, use it in `input.harbor()`
  Avoid useless initialization of SDL systems
- Dynamic loading of lame and aacplus libraries, making it possible to
  ship them as separate binary packages. This is particularly useless
  for non-free libraries and for those that depend on X (e.g., SDL)
  which is often undesirable on servers
- Support for separate compilation of most optional features as plugins
  Use `--enable-<feature>-dynamic-plugin` in ./configure and
  --dynamic-plugins-dir in liquidsoap
- Better Win32 support, more version checks, separate compilation of
  C files and compliance with Debian's OCaml standards
- Externalize many audio and video functions in the new ocaml-mm library
  Factorize and optimize various conversions
- Rewrite harbor and server code using the new Duppy monad,
  introducing camlp4 into the build system
- New regression tests (make test)
- More user-friendly exception printing
- Avoid problems preventing backtrace printing

Miscellaneous:

- Update liguidsoap, make microphone input optional (LS-496)
- Do not crash upon charset-recoding failures [LS-473]
- Fix in `source.dynamic()`: missing source re-selection [LS-354]
- Avoid deadlock on startup in daemon mode [LS-229]
- Fixes in LADSPA and SDL causing early freezing of Frame parameters.
- Fullscreen mode for `output.sdl()`
- Fix: SIGPIPE used to cause crashes (LS-53,LS-287)
- Fix: `video.volume()` could crash upon some end-of-track situationos
- Fix: properly escape filenames in external file duration methods
- Rework timeout management for various sockets (notably icecast & harbor)
  Set nodelay, remove `TCP_*TIMEOUT` [LS-508,LS-509]

  # 1.0.0 beta1 (06-09-2010)

This beta version introduces two major new features: heterogeneous stream
types and clocks.

New:

- Different sources can carry different types of content.
- Encoding formats have been introduced to help infer stream content types.
  This brings static checking for bounds in encoding parameters.
- Introduce conversions between stream contents (mono, stereo, drop
  audio, video, etc) and muxing.
- Allow explicit type annotations in scripts.
- Introduce clocks, cleanly allowing for the coexistence of different
  time flows, and avoiding inconsistencies that can result from it.
  Soundcard I/O and cross-based operators notably make use of it.
- Remove root.sync, replaced by attaching a source s to clock(sync=false,s).
- Enable dynamic source creation and `source.shutdown()`.
- Extend and adapt MIDI and video operators.
- Introduce purely metadata streams (audio=video=midi=0 channels) and
  metadata stream decoder.
- Support WAV streams in `input.http/harbor()`.
- Introduce static image decoder using SDL image.
- Remove bound of request identifies (RID).
- Experimental: `source.dynamic()` for advanced dangerous hacking.
- Make path relative to script in `%include "PATH"`, and introduce
  `%include <...>` where path is relative to liquidsoap library directory.
- Add `channels_matrix` parameter to `output.ao()`.
- Add `on_(dis)connect` hooks in `input.harbor()`.

Cleanup and fixes:

- Lots of cleanup and fixes as with all major code rewriting.
- Optimize video and stabilize it a little bit... still not perfect.
- Rewrite stream and file decoding API, as well as file format detection.
- Enhance shutdown and error message reporting, notably for icecast
  and request-based sources.
- Avoid quasi-infinite loop in failed request resolving.

  # 0.9.3 (04-09-2010)

This release is a bugfix of the latest snapshot (0.9.2).
It will be the last bugfix before 1.0.

Bugs fixed:

- Add "audio/mpegurl" to the list of mime-type for basic playlist parsing.
- Decode arguments passed to `input.harbor`.
- Use Camomile framework to try to recode arguments and user/password
  passed to `input.harbor`.
- Support Theora 1.1 API via ocaml-theora 0.2.0.
- Fixed `input.lastfm`.
- Fixed SDL output.
- Allow magic file type detection to follow symlinks.

  # 0.9.2 (29-10-2009)

This release is a SNAPSHOT of upcoming features. It also contains several
important bugfixes. As a snapshot, it contains experimental or unpolished
features, and also breaks compatibility with previous versions.
You should in particular notice the two "New" items below:

- `random(strict=true)` is now called `rotate()`;
- request sources (`playlists`, `request.*`) have a new queuing behavior,
  check the doc (request-sources.html) or revert to conservative=true.

Bugs fixed:

- Ogg encoder now muxes pages according to their ending time.
- Support "ogg/audio" and "ogg/video" mime types for HTTP ogg streams.
- Changed external encoder's "restart_encoder" to the more relevant
  "restart_on_new_track". Added optional "restart_after_delay"
  to restart the encoder after some delay. Also completely rewrite
  stop mechanism. Stop operation now waits for the encoding process
  to finish, allowing proper restart_on_new_track like for ogg encoded
  data.
- Factorized buffered I/O code. Also added a blocking API, which avoids
  "no available frame" and "reader not ready" messages and audio glitches.
  It enforces that `root.sync` be deactivated for these sources, such that
  synchronization is done by the source. (#203)
- Factorized file decoding code.
- Fixed reversed order when parsing playlists using `playlist.parse()`.
- Avoid bad crashes when resources lack, e.g. no more memory.
- Tighten and enforce the inter-source protocol.
- All outputs: fix the autostart server command. With the former code,
  a modification of the autostart parameter was only taken into account
  one start/stop cycle later.
- `on_blank()`: fix a bug that prevented the first call to on_noise.
- Fixed estimated remaining samples on ogg files, fixes issues with
  operators relying on this value, in particular `crossfade()` and
  request-based sources when operating in non-conservative mode.
- Fixed socket descriptor leak in `input.http`. (#318)
- Fixed deadlock at init when an exception was raised at wake_up
  phase. (#319)
- Fix `delay()` which could sometimes incorrectly declare itself ready,
  and thus try to get some data from its unavailable input source.
- Bug in queue duration estimation led to infinite feeding of the queue,
  until all request IDs are taken.
- Several fixes enforcing clean (non-deadlocking) sleep/shutdown.

New:

- The operator `rotate()` replaces random(strict=true), and `random()`
  does not have a strict parameter anymore.
- Switch to new behaviour in request-based sources.
  Use conservative=true to get to the old behaviour.
- `on_blank()`: provide an `on_noise` handler.
- `playlist*()`: add server commands for reloading the playlist and changing
  its URI.
- Fallible outputs: all outputs now have a fallible mode, in which
  they accept fallible sources, and automatically start/stop when the child
  fails to stream.
- EXPERIMENTAL ogg/dirac encoding support.
- `output.*.aacplus()`: native outputs encoding in AAC+ using ocaml-aacplus.
- Switched to a custom implementation of the various shout protocols.
  It notably allows arbitrary content-type settings which enables
  AAC+ streaming. Enabled wrappers for external encoders for AAC+ format
  aacplusenc (#220 and #136). Also added custom IRC, AIM and ICQ headers
  to shoutcast wrappers (#192).
- Harbor now supports Shoutcast/ICY headers properly. This allows in
  particular the use of any supported data format for the source client.
- Harbor sources now also consider "song" field when updating metadata.
- Added built-in support for m4a audio files and metadata.
  Made external support optional through enable_faad.
- Added optional resampling for output.external operators (#273).
- Added optional host and port parameters for audioscrobbling
  submissions. Allows to use alternate systems, such as libre.fm
  of jamendo's compatibility API. Added nowplaying submission,
  and various wrappers, including a full submission process
  (now playing at beginning, submit some times before the end).
- New variables in the script language: `liquidsoap.version` and
  `configure.{libdir,pidfile,logdir}`.
- Added built-in support for replay_gain, through the replay_gain protocol
  (enabled by default) and the replay gain metadata resolver (to be enabled
  using `enable_replaygain_metadata()`). (#103 & #317)
- Reverse DNS operations can be disabled using settings keys
  `server.telnet.reverse_dns` and `harbor.reverse_dns`.

Experimental:

- MIDI: file decoding, synthesis, virtual keyboard.

Removed:

- RTP input and output.
- Removed decoders using ocaml-natty. Slow, unmaintained and superseded
  by the mplayer decoder.

  # 0.9.1 (18-06-2009)

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed request task not ending properly for request-driven sources (playlist,
  request.queue, request.equeue). Fixes a problem reported when reloading
  an empty playlist multiple times. (#269)
- Fixed math.h usage in rgb_c.c.
- Fixed append operator. (#284)
- Fixed OSS compilation for non-linux systems.
- Disconnect idle harbor sources after timeout has expired.
  Thanks to Roman Savrulin for reporting and fixing !
- Taglib metadata resolver is only used on files decoded
  by the MP3 decoder.

New:

- Get a node's striping status when stripping
  blank with `strip_blank` (#260).
- `on_connect` function for `input.harbor` now receives the
  list of headers given by the connected source (#266).
- Added `on_end` operator, to execute a handler when a track ends.
- Added estimated remaining time in the queue length for request-driven
  sources (`request.{equeue,queue}`, `playlist`). This allows these sources
  to prepare less files in advance. In particular, primary queue may
  only contain the file currently played. Default behaviour has been
  set to the old behaviour, and a conservative option has
  been added to switch to the new behaviour. New behavivour
  will be the default for the next release.
  fixes #169, references #146

  # 0.9.0 (01-03-2009)

- Use random temporary file in liGuidsoap.
- Fixed liGuidsoap to use the (not so) new metadata field initial_uri.
- Fix bugs in the life cycle (sleep/wake_up) of queued request sources,
  which made `say_metadata` unfunctional.
- Remove buggy unbuffered `{input,output}.jack`. (#231)
- Fixed audio information sent to icecast. (#226)
- Fixed global reset starting inactive sources. (#227)
- Fixed shoutcast source initial answer in harbor. (#254)

  in the documentation
- Propagate new delay in add_timeout
- Fixed inter-thread mutex lock/unlock in playlist.ml
- Fixed "next" playlist command
- Fixed race conditions in request_source.ml feeding task
- cross/smartcross: raise the default for inhibition as
  setting it to exactly duration is not enough
- Don't fail when $HOME is not set
- Fixed metadata update in `input.harbor` with icecast2 source protocol
- Fixed shutdown function. Fixes #153
- Fixed `input.oss`. Liquidsoap now works with OSS4 ! Fixes #158

New:

- Enhanced smart_crossfade
- Added string.case and string.capitalize
- New "exec_at" operator, to execute a function depending on a given predicate
- Added script example in the documentation to listen to radio Nova and get
  the metadata from a web page.
- Changed parameters name in fallback.skip to reflect who are the fallback
  and input source.
- Added a dump file parameter to `input.harbor`, for debugging purpose.
- Added an auth function parameter to `input.harbor` for custom
  authentifications. Fixes #157
- Added "primary_queue" and "secondary_queue" commands to request.queue and
  request.equeue sources. Also set the metadata "queue" to either "primary"
  or "secondary" for each request in the queue. Documented it too.
- Insert latest metadata for a node of a switch source when switching
  back to it in a middle of a track.
- Added a 'conservative' parameter to cross, smilar to the one in smartcross.

Internal:

- Enhanced liqi documentation parser to build the website.

  # 0.3.7 (03-06-2008)

Bugs fixed:

- Now works on FreeBSD and hopefully other unices that are stricter than
  Linux about Mutex usage.
- `input.http()` now has a `bind_address` parameter.
- Harbor socket now has a timeout for lost connections.
- `smartcross()` is now more compliant with the inter-sources protocol,
  fixes several "get frame didn't change the buffer" bugs.
- Ogg packeting bugs.
- Buffering policy in `input.http/harbor()`.
- No "." in IDs and labels.
- Resources: FD leaks, useless threads (threads leaks?) in `input.http()`.
- `fade.out()` used to run into infinite loops when the delay was 0.

New:

- New documentation system and website.
- Self-documenting server with a more helpful "help" command.
- Moved to duppy: less threads, lighter load, and an configurable scheduler.
- Moved to Taglib for more reliable access to MP3 metadata.
- MIME types, notably for playlists and MP3 files.
- New Jack support. The old one has been renamed to `in/output.jack.legacy()`.
- Harbor: per-mount passwords and the stop command to kick a source client.
- Official Last.FM client.
- Metadata is no more punctual but interval-based, which suppresses some
  surprising behaviours.
- Perfected daemon behaviour.
- All `output.file.*()` now have the features that used to be only in
  `output.file.vorbis()`, notable re-opening. Added %w to the strftime-like
  format codes allowed in their filename parameter.
- Add `clear_metadata()` and `map_metadata()`. Now, `rewrite_metadata()` is a simple
  specialization of `map_metadata()`, written in utils.liq.
- Dynamic amplification factor in `amplify()`, e.g. useful for replay gain.
- Lots of new functions in the scripting API: for lists, requests, system
  interaction, shutdown, command-line parsing, scripted server commands, etc.

As always:

- code cleanup, style, etc.

  # 0.3.4 (25-09-2007)

Notation: "-" stands for a change, "+" for an addition.

- Language
  - Support for polymorphism, subtyping and basic ad-hoc polymorphism,
    which allows a much simpler API, notably for maths and serialization.
  * Added `interactive_*()` for mutable values.
  - The right syntax for settings is now set("var", value) and can be used
    anywhere in the scripts.
  - The volume parameters of most operators are now in dB.
  - Many builtin functions added.
  - Nicer type error messages.
- Sources
  - Added `input.lastfm()` to relay last.fm streams.
  - Added `input.harbor()` to received Icecast2 source streams.
  - Added `noise()` to generate white noise
  * Reimplemented playlist support, added various xml and text formats.
  * Added mpd protocol to find files using mpd.
- Operators
  - New effects: `compress()`, `flanger()`, `pan()`.
  - New filters: `filter.fir.*()`, `filter.iir.*()`, `filter.biquad.*()`, `comb()`.
  - Added support for LADSPA effects.
  - Added `eat_blank()` to remove blanks.
- Outputs
  - Added non-default restart option for `output.icecast.*()`.
  - Added the possibility to tweak some settings at runtime.
  - Split `output.icecast.vorbis()` into `output.icecast.vorbis.*()` to distinguish
    between encoding modes -- and similarly for output.file.vorbis and mp3.
  - Better handling of Icecast disconnections.
- IO
  - Added portaudio support.
  * Jack support is now somewhat working.
- As usual, lots of bug fixes, careful polishing & much more...

  # 0.3.3 (06-06-2007)

- Major cleanup of the core stream representation; moved to float arrays,
  removing several back-and-forth conversions and enhancing the perfs a lot;
  reviewed all sources and operators, made many minor enhancements btw.
- Lots of sound processing operators: compand, compress, normalize,
  pitch, bpm, soundtouch, saw, square, etc. Add more shapes to `fade.*()`.
- New track processing operators: insert_metadata, on_track.
- Smart cross: allows to select a transition based on the volumes around the
  end-of-track.
- Support for AAC encoding/decoding.
- Several fixes to output.icecast.mp3 in order to support shoutcast servers.
- Automatic format recognition for `input.http()`, support for playlists.
- OSS I/O.
- Unbuffered ALSA I/O for low latency.
- Server interface via UNIX domain sockets.
- Better output.file.vorbis with support for re-opening the file, appending,
  interpolate strftime format codes, etc.
- Add pre-processing and math primitives to the language, new `_[_]` notation for
  `assoc()`, ruby-style anti-quotation `("..#{..}..")`, `add_timeout()`, `execute()`,
  `log()`...
- Ability to tweak the internal PCM stream format.
- Classify sources and operators in categories for more structured doc.
- Started a few visualization operators, text and graphics based.
- Several bug fixes: request leaks, sine frequency, switch, etc.

  # 0.3.2 (16-03-2007)

- New portable output to speakers using `libao()`.
- Updated liGuidsoap to use it until ALSA gets enhanced.
- Implemented a decent estimation of the remaining time in a track.
- Added the `cross()` operator allowing cross-fading.
- Generalized `say_metadata()` into `append()` and `prepend()`.
- Per-track settings for `cross()`, `fade.*()`, `prepend()` and `append()`
  using requests' metadatas.
- Implemented `input.http.mp3()`, including support for icy metadata.
- New `pipe()` operator which allows one to filter the raw audio through an
  external program. However, sox and other common tools aren't suitable for that
  because they don't flush their output often enough.
- New `on_blank()` operator for calling a callback on excessive blanks.
- Restart outputs on insane latencies.
- Type checkings for settings.
- Setting for not starting the internal telnet server.
- Now handles old and new versions of Camomile correctly.
- Internal fixes and polishing (switches' cached selection, empty tracks..)

  # 0.3.1 (17-11-2006)

- More standards-compliant tarball
- Generate doc with locally built liquidsoap
- Try to cope with ill-formed mp3
- Updated for newer versions of Camomile
- So-called "strict" random-mode

  # 0.3.0 (27-08-2006)

- Many minor and major fixes at every level!
- Conversion of metadata to UTF8.
- Got rid of too many threads by scheduling all download tasks
  in a single thread, and handling all of the server's clients
  in another single thread.
- Simplified the time interval syntax and integrated it to the script language.
- New protocol: Wget for FTP, HTTP and HTTPS.
- Ability to define a new protocol from the script,
  typically using an external app/script for resolution, such as bubble.
- Ability to use an external app/script for dynamically creating requests.
- New `on_metadata` operator for performing arbitrary actions (typically
  a call to an external script) when metadata packets occur in a stream.
- MP3 encoding, to file or shout.
- API renamings and simplification.
- Supports transition, as functions of type (source,source) -> source
  in all switching operators: schedule, random, fallback.
- Restart icecast2 outputs on failures.
- Major changes to the scripting language which is more uniform and flexible,
  has functions, a helpful (?) type inference, and a simple Ruby-like syntax.
- Timing constraints and synchronization are managed by Root
  in a centralized way, no more by the many outputs which need it.
- Audio decoding is no more based on file extensions,
  but on the existence of a valid decoder.
- Added the equeue operators which allows interactive building of playlists,
  supporting insertion and moving of queued requests -- queue only allows
  you to push requests and cancel queued requests.
- A Python-Gtk GUI for controlling operators, or more specifically as a console
  for creating your live show -- to be updated, still unstable.
- Alsa input and output.
- Blank detection, automatically skips on too long blanks, or strip them.
- Http ogg/vorbis relay, the way to relay live shows.
- Interactive mixer.
- The request system was mostly rewritten to really fulfill its specification.
- The server is no more associated to the queue operator but is now something
  external, in which all operators can plug commands. This much more logical
  design lead to many more interactive controls. The syntax of command outputs
  was also simplified for easier automated processing.
- Dynamic loading of plugins.
- Outputs are now operators. It makes it possible to output different streams
  in a single instance of Liquidsoap, which RadioPi needed. As a consequence
  we removed the restriction that one source must have at most one father,
  without any extra burden for the user.

  # 0.2.0 (20-04-2005)

- Proper initial release.

  # 0.1.0 (2004)

- Release for academic demonstration, not functional.
