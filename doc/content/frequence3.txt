title:Fréquence 3

h3. Fréquence 3

"Fréquence 3":http://www.frequence3.fr uses Liquidsoap mainly on the backstage,
for different purposes:

* transcoding for different formats (OGG, weird MP3 relays...)
* scheduling and playlist for audio backup streams, and test streams
* blank detection

They look forward to using Liquidsoap even more, and work with the Savonet team
to make sure this tool can ease the work of webradios :)

They provide an MP3 stream "here":http://streams.frequence3.net/mp3-128.m3u.
