The Liquidsoap book
===================

Together with the release of Liquidsoap 2.0, we have written _the Liquidsoap
book_ which covers in details the language and the process of building a
radio. It complements the online documentation by providing a homogeneous and
progressive presentation of Liquidsoap.
