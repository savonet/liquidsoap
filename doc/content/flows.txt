title: Liquid Flows

h3. Liquid Flows

We maintain a "webpage of streams generated by
Liquidsoap":http://savonet.sourceforge.net/flows.html, that we like to call
_Liquidsoap Flows_. In order to register your radio on this page, a simple
operator called @register_flow@ is provided. If your stream is called @stream@,
you can register it with

%%
stream = register_flow(
  radio="My radio",
  website="http://my.web.site/",
  description="The sound of my computer",
  genre="reggae",
  user="foo",
  password="bar",
  streams=[("mp3/128k","http://my.web.site/stream")],
  stream)
%%

All the parameters should be pretty explicit: @radio@ is the name of the radio,
@website@ is the url of the website of the radio, etc. The only subtle parameter
is @streams@: it is a list of pairs of strings describing the format of the
stream and the url of the stream (we use a list here because one radio can be
broadcasted under multiple stream formats). The format should always be of the
form @codec/bitrate@ (e.g. @mp3/128k@) or @codec@ if it is encoded in variable
bitrate.
