h3. Documentation index

**How to use**: Start with the "quickstart":quick_start.html and make sure you
learn "how to find help":help.html. Then it's as you like: go for another
"general tutorial":#general, or a "specific example":#specific, pick a "basic
notion":#core, or some examples from the "cookbook":cookbook.html. If you've
understood all you need, just browse the "reference":reference.html and compose
your dream stream.

If you downloaded a source tarball of liquidsoap, you may first read the
"build instructions":build.html.

If you are looking for a way to build a distribution-independant bundle of
liquidsoap, you may want to read the "custom path":custom-path.html page.
