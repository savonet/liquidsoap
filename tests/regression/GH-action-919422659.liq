# In https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/runs/919422659,
# GH1159.liq started failing. Further investigation revealed
# that GH1159.liq was originally intended to use with the FLAC
# decoder so it was set back to only use it. This test is a
# copy of it with decoder forced to FFMPEG, the one originally
# failing in the github action run & serves as regresstion test
# for this case.
